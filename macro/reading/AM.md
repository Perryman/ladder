Felt like reading some old papers for inspiration.

## [AM: An Artificial Intelligence Approach to Discovery in Mathematics as Heuristic Search, July 1976.](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA155378.pdf)

- Douglas notes the name "AM" was changed, and was originally "I AM" as in the Exodus verse, as he explains in a footnote. Fitting the theme of attempting to develop AI heuristics for mathematical creativity.

    - Funded by ARPA, might be interesting finding early ARPA AI/math projects for inspiration.

- "It is usually easier to tackle a specific given problem than to propose interesting yet manageable new questions to investigate."

    - The discovery of the unknown unknowns, by blind exploration, heuristic, or looking at the shape of a domain and spotting the conspicuously inconspicuous.

    - Set theory was the basis. Something like category theory or another fundamental math building block could just as well be used, I suppose.

- He discusses how to analyze theories working backward/splitting into smaller creative acts. That could combine with estimating how interesting each concept is.

    - Could existing theories (or, e.g. logic relations) be deconstructed similarly, in order to build a reasonable scoring function, perhaps similar to Markov Chains and AI, from Aurelien Geron's book on machine learning.

- "AM's activities all serve to expand AM itself, to enlarge upon a given body of mathematical knowledge.

    - Something like this with an alphago/alphazero approach might be interesting, if one decided to use an NN-based discovery approach.

    - Where could this fit in with present-day approaches to build a unified theorem prover encyclopedia?

- They started with 25 "facets or slots" and "115 core concepts," curious to learn how those were encoded or decided, being unfamiliar myself with pure logic notation. Q: What notation did they use and why?

    - 

- They were surprised to find "de-tuning" was robust and e.g. equality was one of the more impactful concepts. Design of experiments could be utilized to benchmark the more promising heuristics, or perhaps find new ones.

    - [BEINGS: KNOWLEDGE AS INTERACTING EXPERTS](https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/75/Papers/018.pdf) Hard to find an open-access clean scan, but it reminds me of modern mixture of experts approaches, except in the pure logic or math domain, at a glance.

    - [Cyc (pronounced SYKE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyc) "An inference engine is a computer program that tries to derive answers from a knowledge base. The Cyc inference engine performs general logical deduction.[8] It also performs inductive reasoning, statistical machine learning and symbolic machine learning, and abductive reasoning."
